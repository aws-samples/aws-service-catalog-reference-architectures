Managing your application metadata using Service Catalog App Registry 

Organizations have many applications and the metadata that they must keep track of for different business use cases. AWS Service Catalog AppRegistry can be used to manage, track, and display applications and their metadata across accounts and regions. This gives an enterprise a fast and efficient way to find and view applications and see application metadata.  They can then use this information to address several use cases, including CMDB, ITSM, and others.
