## Create speech-enabled products using AWS Service Catalog and Amazon Polly 

In this post, we’ll show how enterprises can use AWS Service Catalog to create AWS Service
Catalog products based on AWS machine learning (ML) services, such as Amazon Polly and
Amazon Rekognition.

These products are packaged in AWS Service Catalog portfolios that customers can use for
their use cases. These portfolios can generate revenue for service provider when deployed in a
service provider managed environment. In this post, we’ll focus on a use case for Amazon Polly.

Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech, which in turn lets you create
applications that can talk and build speech-enabled products. Amazon Polly uses advanced
deep learning technology to synthesize speech that sounds like the human voice. Many
organizations need to provide spoken responses with their web and mobile applications, like
accessibility applications for visually impaired people, news readers, story readers, e-learning
platforms, and internet connected devices. Amazon Polly produces high-quality audio files
with superior natural speech, high pronunciation accuracy and low latency, all in a cost-
effective manner.
