**Managing cross-Region reports for AWS Marketplace and AWS Service Catalog resources**

Organizations have many business reasons to track resource usage across their AWS environments. For example, management and administrative teams want to track operation expenditure, license governance, and asset tracking for their AWS Marketplace solutions across Regions currently in use. A centralized reporting dashboard allows the teams to access this information quickly and efficiently.

This post will show you how to create cross-region deployment reports. They will contain information on any AWS service deployed via Service Catalog, e.g., storage, databases, containers, and any third-party Marketplace ISV solutions. Organizations can view all AWS Service Catalog deployments in these reports in a simple, easy-to-use dashboard.
